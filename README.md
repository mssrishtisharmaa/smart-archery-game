## Overview

The **ESP32 Smart Archery Game** is an IoT-based real-time archery scoring system that combines embedded systems, cloud computing, and modern web technologies to automate the traditional archery scoring process.

The system uses an **ESP32 microcontroller** connected to **IR sensors** to detect arrow hits on the target. Whenever a hit is detected, the ESP32 instantly communicates with the web application, where scores are processed, synchronized with **Firebase Realtime Database**, and displayed on a responsive dashboard in real time.

Unlike conventional manual scoring methods, this project provides **instant score calculation**, **live leaderboard updates**, **multi-level gameplay**, and a seamless user experience by integrating hardware and software into a single connected ecosystem.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of **IoT systems**, **embedded programming**, **real-time communication**, **cloud integration**, and **responsive web application development**.

##  How It Works

1. The player enters their name and starts the game.
2. The ESP32 continuously monitors the IR sensors mounted behind the target.
3. When an arrow interrupts an IR beam, the ESP32 detects the hit.
4. The hit event is transmitted through WebSocket communication.
5. The web application processes the event and updates the player's score.
6. Scores are stored in Firebase Realtime Database.
7. The leaderboard updates instantly for all connected users.
8. Players unlock Level 2 by achieving the required score in Level 1.
